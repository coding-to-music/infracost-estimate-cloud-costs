## Get started

Follow our [**quick start guide**](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#quick-start) to get started üöÄ

Infracost also has many CI/CD integrations so you can easily post cost estimates in pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

## Supported clouds and resources

Infracost supports over **230** Terraform resources across [AWS](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/aws), [Azure](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/azure) and [Google](https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources/google). Other IaC tools, such as [Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187), [AWS CloudFormation/CDK](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190) and [Azure ARM/Bicep](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/812) are on our roadmap.

Infracost can also estimate [usage-based resources](https://www.infracost.io/docs/usage_based_resources) such as AWS S3 or Lambda!

# Get started

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/docs/master/docs/getting_started.md

## description: Get started with Infracost in your Terraform workflow, integrate it into your CI pipeline and view cost estimates for your AWS/Azure/Google infrastructure.

Infracost shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform. It lets DevOps, SRE and engineers see a cost breakdown and understand costs **before making changes**, either in the terminal or pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

If you're upgrading from an older version, see the [v0.10 migration guide](/docs/guides/v0.10_migration/).

### 1. Install Infracost

### macOS/Linux manual

The easiest way is to use our install script:

# Downloads the CLI based on your OS/arch and puts it in /usr/local/bin

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infracost/infracost/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Or you can install it manually:

- Download the archive for your platform from our releases.
- Unarchive and copy it to one of the directories in your $PATH, e.g. /usr/local/bin:

```
tar xzf infracost-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp
```

```
mv /tmp/infracost-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/infracost
```

Check that it works correctly:

```
infracost --version # Should show 0.10.10
```

### Get the latest Infracost release using docker:

```shell
docker pull infracost/infracost:ci-latest

docker run --rm \
  -e INFRACOST_API_KEY=see_following_step_on_how_to_get_this \
  -v $PWD/:/code/ infracost/infracost:ci-latest breakdown --path /code/
  # Add other required flags/envs, e.g. --terraform-var-file or --terraform-var

docker run --rm \
  -e INFRACOST_API_KEY=$INFRACOST_API_KEY \
  -v $PWD/:/code/ infracost/infracost:ci-latest breakdown --path /code/
```

Output

```
Error: Error processing module at '/code/cmd/infracost/testdata/breakdown_terragrunt_get_env/dev/terragrunt.hcl'. How this module was found: Terragrunt config file found in a subdirectory of /code/. Underlying error: /code/cmd/infracost/testdata/breakdown_terragrunt_get_env/dev/terragrunt.hcl:6,9-17: Error in function call; Call to function "get_env" failed: EnvVarNotFound: Required environment variable CUSTOM_OS_VAR - not found.
```

### 2. Get API key

Register for a free API key, which is used by the CLI to retrieve prices from our Cloud Pricing API, e.g. get prices for instance types.

:::note

- No cloud credentials or secrets are [sent](/docs/faq/#what-data-is-sent-to-the-cloud-pricing-api) to the API and you can also [self-host](/docs/cloud_pricing_api/self_hosted/) it.
- Infracost does not make any changes to your Terraform state or cloud resources.
  :::

```shell
infracost auth login
```

The key can be retrieved with `infracost configure get api_key`.

---

### 3. Show cost estimate breakdown

Infracost parses the project locally to determine resource types and quantities needed to calculate costs. The [`--path` flag](/docs/features/cli_commands/#breakdown) can point to a Terraform directory or plan JSON file.

```shell
# You can also: git clone https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform
cd my-terraform-project
```

```shell
# Terraform variables can be set using --terraform-var-file or --terraform-var
infracost breakdown --path .
```

<p>
Example output:
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/screenshots/get-started-breakdown.png")} alt="Infracost breakdown command" />
</p>

:::tip
Infracost can also estimate [usage-based resources](/docs/features/usage_based_resources/) such as AWS S3 or Lambda
:::

---

### 4. Show cost estimate diff

<ol type="i">
  <li>Generate an Infracost JSON file as the baseline:</li>

```shell
infracost breakdown --path . --format json --out-file infracost-base.json
```

  <li>Edit your Terraform project. If you're using our example project, try changing the instance type:</li>

```shell
vim main.tf
```

  <li>Generate a diff by comparing the latest code change with the baseline:</li>

```shell
infracost diff --path . --compare-to infracost-base.json
```

</ol>

<p>
Example output:
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/screenshots/get-started-diff.png")} alt="Infracost diff command" />
</p>

---

### 5. Monitor cost estimates

<ol type="i">
  <li>The following environment variable instructs the CLI to send its JSON output to Infracost Cloud. This is our SaaS product that builds on top of Infracost open source and works with CI/CD integrations (next step). It enables team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners to see all cost estimates from a central place so they can help guide the team.</li>

```shell
INFRACOST_ENABLE_CLOUD=true infracost diff \
    --path . --compare-to infracost-base.json
```

  <li>
    Log in to <a href="https://dashboard.infracost.io">Infracost Cloud</a> > <b>Projects</b> page to see the cost estimate.
  </li>
</ol>

---

### 6. Add to your CI/CD

[Use our CI/CD integrations](/docs/integrations/cicd) to add cost estimates to pull requests, it only takes 15 minutes. This provides your team with a safety net as people can understand cloud costs upfront, and discuss them as part of your workflow.

If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly üòÑ
